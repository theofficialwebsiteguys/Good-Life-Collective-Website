        <p>
          While Good Life Collective is new to the City of Rochester, it is not new to the cannabis industry.
          The Hernandez Family, who owns and operates Good Life Collective, also owns and operates a Good Life
          Collective retail store in <strong>Astoria, Oregon</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hiram Hernandez, Jr.</strong> and his three adult children will each play a role in managing the
          retail enterprises with the goal of providing the opportunity for the Hernandez family and others involved in
          this venture to experience—just that—the <strong>Good Life</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are excited to extend that Good Life to our staff, customers, and the community at large.
